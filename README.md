# Diary
A program that makes a diary for you.
THIS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS
You can create, edit, and view entries that you've written.
Fully customizable! You can change the path of where the diary is located in the definitions at the top.
Password protected... sort of. You can still open the .txt manually and, very easily, change/view the password.
I was bored, then this happened.
It's very unoptimized and sloppy, I know, but it is what it is, and it works so I'm not complaining.
